      <p>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a 2007 fantasy film directed by David Yates from a screenplay by Michael Goldenberg, based on the 2003 novel of the same name by J. K. Rowling. It is the sequel to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) and the fifth instalment in the Harry Potter film series. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Its story follows Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as the Ministry of Magic is in denial of Lord Voldemort's return.

        Filming took place in England and Scotland for exterior locations and Leavesden Film Studios in Watford for interior locations from February to November 2006, with a one-month break in June. Post-production on the film continued for several months afterwards to add in visual effects. The film's budget was reportedly between £75 and 100 million ($150–200 million).[4][5]
        
        Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was released in 2D cinemas and IMAX formats in the United States on 11 July 2007 and in the United Kingdom on 12 July, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, particularly for Imelda Staunton's performance as Dolores Umbridge, and opened to a worldwide five-day opening of $333 million and grossed $942 million total, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 2007.[7][8] It has been noted as a case of Hollywood accounting, as Warner Bros. claimed the film lost $167 million, despite its total gross. The film was nominated for many awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Production Design and Special Visual Effects.
        
        It was followed by Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince in 2009.</p>
